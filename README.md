# GoodBooks-Recommender

Have you ever wondered which book to read next? I often have and to me, book recommendations are a fascinating issue. This external [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/zygmunt/goodbooks-10k) allows us to take a deeper look at data-driven book recommendations.

This Project is splitted into 3 parts:
- Part I: [The Story of Book](https://github.com/OmarZaghlol/GoodBooks-Recommender/blob/master/Goodreads-1-The-Story-of-Book.ipynb)
    - Explore the dataset to find some interesting insights.
- Part II: [Book Recommender System](https://github.com/OmarZaghlol/GoodBooks-Recommender/blob/master/Goodreads-2-Book-Recommender-System.ipynb)
    - Build Recommender Systems using various techniques.
- Part III: [Web App](https://github.com/OmarZaghlol/GoodBooks-Recommender/blob/master/app.py)
    - Build a web app to try some recommendations from our algorithms.
    
**Note:** To run the web app
- from `start` open `Anaconda Prompt`
- then go to the project directory using `cd` command
- type `python app.py`
- finally, in a new tab in your browser, go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` and Enjoy!
